        <div id="about-content">
          <p>Hey there, I'm Peter, a passionate Computer Science major currently pursuing my education at the
            University of Houston! I've loved technology and problem-solving ever since I was a kid, and I'm
            always eager to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed with coding, you'll often find me indulging in my favorite hobbies. I've loved
            video games ever since I was 5 years old, playing on consoles (PS2, Wii, GameCube) and eventually
            switched to PC games when I was 10, playing games like Minecraft and League of Legends (I still play
            them to this day). I've been obsessed with all things computer-related since then, even building my own
            computer and keyboard!
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the digital realm, I'm a fitness enthusiast who enjoys the rush of a good workout, lifting
            heavy iron circles over and over again.. For an adrenaline kick, I recently started to boulder
            and top rope climb, which constantly pushes me to overcome new heights. Sports is also integrated
            into my lifestyle, playing mostly volleyball, ping pong, and tennis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for looking at my page, and heres my <a href="assests/PeterMendozaResume9-7-2023.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#cdd5f1; cursor:pointer; text-decoration: underline;">resume</a> if you're interested!

        <p>Since I did not have work authorization until recent, I focused on honing my skills and knowledge of past
          courses I have taken by tutoring peers in said courses for free. I typically helped with introductory Math and Computer
          Science coursework (mainly Calculus 1, Discrete Math, Intro to Programming, Programming and Data Structures),
          and doing so helped me retain the information as well. I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2024, and
          I am expected to graduate in Dec. 2024. Please reach out to me via email or LinkedIn for any inquiries!
